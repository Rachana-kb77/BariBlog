# BariBlog


BariBlog is a fullâ€‘stack blog application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The repo is organized into a client folder (front-end React app) and a server folder (Express RESTful API), enabling users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts through an intuitive and responsive interface. It demonstrates standard CRUD operations, state management in React, API routing in Node.js, and data persistence with MongoDB 

The screenshots folder showcases key UI views like the post list, editor, and detail pages, giving a quick visual tour of core functionality.
